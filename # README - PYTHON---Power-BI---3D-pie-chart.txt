To create a Python script that generates a 3D pie chart and integrate it into Power BI, you can follow these steps:

Install Required Libraries: First, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You'll need matplotlib for creating the pie chart and pandas for handling data.

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib pandas
Write Python Script: Write a Python script that generates the 3D pie chart using matplotlib.

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample data
labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
sizes = [15, 30, 45, 10]

# Create a pie chart
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
ax.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)

# Set aspect ratio to be equal so that pie is drawn as a circle.
ax.set_aspect('equal')

# Show plot
plt.show()
Integrate with Power BI:

Open Power BI and load your data.
Go to "Home" > "Transform Data" to open Power Query Editor.
Click on "New Source" > "Python Script" in the "Home" tab.
Paste your Python script into the script editor.
Click on "OK" to run the script.
Power BI will generate a new table with the data returned from the Python script.
Close the Power Query Editor and go back to your report canvas.
Add a new visual (e.g., Table or Matrix).
Select the fields returned from the Python script to visualize the 3D pie chart.
Adjust the Visual:

Customize the visual appearance, such as labels, colors, and layout, to fit your requirements.
You can adjust the Python script to read data from your dataset dynamically if needed.
Save and Publish:

Once you're satisfied with the report, save your Power BI file.
Publish your report to Power BI Service if you want to share it with others.
This script generates a basic 3D pie chart. You can further customize it by exploring the documentation of matplotlib to add more features like colors, shadows, and explode slices. Additionally, you can modify the script to read data dynamically from your dataset in Power BI.
